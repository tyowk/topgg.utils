# **Topgg Utils**

Topgg Utils is a Node.js API wrapper designed for interacting with the Top.gg API. It simplifies the process of fetching bot and user data, managing statistics, and handling webhook events for votes.

---

## **Features**

- **Data Fetching:** Retrieve detailed bot, user, and voting data from Top.gg with ease.
- **Statistics Management:** Effortlessly post and update bot statistics to Top.gg.
- **Webhook Support:** Easily manage vote events through webhooks.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Respond to various events like bot votes, guild votes, and error handling in a streamlined manner.

---

## **Installation**

To install the Topgg Utils package, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install topgg.utils
```

---

## **Usage Guide**

### **Importing the Library**

Import the `Manager` class from the `topgg.utils` package to interact with the API.

```javascript
const { Manager } = require('topgg.utils');
```

---

### **Example: Creating a Bot Manager Instance**

To interact with the Top.gg API, you need to initialize a `Manager` instance with your API token and webhook configuration.

```javascript
// Initialize a new Manager instance
const manager = new Manager({
    token: 'YOUR_API_TOKEN',                // Your Top.gg API token
    webhook: {
        port: 3000,                         // Port for the webhook server
        endpoint: '/webhook',               // Webhook endpoint
        authorization: 'YOUR_WEBHOOK_AUTH', // Webhook authorization token
    }
});

// Listen to the 'ready' event when the manager is initialized
manager.on('ready', () => {
    console.log('Topgg.utils manager is ready!');
});
```

In this example:
- Replace `'YOUR_API_TOKEN'` with your actual Top.gg API token.
- Set a port for the webhook server to listen on (default is usually 3000).
- Set a webhook authorization token for secure webhook handling.

---

### **Fetching Bot Data**

You can retrieve information about your bot (using its ID) with the following code:

```javascript
// Function to fetch bot data using its ID
async function fetchBotData(botId) {
    const botData = await manager.getBot(botId);
    console.log(botData); // Logs the bot's data
}

// Example usage
fetchBotData('YOUR_BOT_ID');
```

This function will return various details about the bot, such as its name, description, server count, and more.

---

### **Posting Bot Statistics**

To keep your bot's statistics up-to-date on Top.gg, use the `postStats` method. This method takes the bot ID and an object containing the statistics.

```javascript
// Function to update bot stats on Top.gg
async function updateBotStats(botId) {
    await manager.postStats(botId, {
        server_count: 100,        // Total number of servers
        shards: [0, 1],           // Shard IDs (optional)
        shard_count: 2,           // Total number of shards
    });
}

// Example usage
updateBotStats('YOUR_BOT_ID');
```

In this example:
- `server_count` is the total number of servers your bot is in.
- `shards` is an array of shard IDs (if using sharding).
- `shard_count` is the total number of shards.

---

### **Handling Webhook Events**

The `Manager` class allows you to listen to events triggered by user votes. The most common events are `BotVote` and `GuildVote`.

#### **Bot Vote Event**

When a user votes for your bot, the `botVote` event is triggered.

```javascript
// Listen for BotVote events when a user votes for your bot
manager.on('botVote', (vote) => {
    console.log(`User ${vote.userId} voted for bot ${vote.botId}`);
});
```

#### **Guild Vote Event**

Similarly, when a user votes for a guild, the `guildVote` event is triggered.

```javascript
// Listen for GuildVote events when a user votes for a guild
manager.on('guildVote', (vote) => {
    console.log(`User ${vote.userId} voted for guild ${vote.guildId}`);
});
```

---

### **Handling Errors**

You can handle errors that might occur during API interactions or event handling.

```javascript
// Listen for errors
manager.on('error', (error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
});
```

This will log any errors that occur, such as issues with posting statistics or handling webhook requests.

---

## **Available Events**

The following events are available for you to listen to:

```javascript
const { Events } = require('topgg.utils');

// Event triggered when the manager is ready
manager.on(Events.Ready, () => {
    console.log('Manager is now ready!');
});

// Event triggered when a bot is voted for
manager.on(Events.BotVote, (vote) => {
    console.log(`User ${vote.userId} voted for bot ${vote.botId}`);
});

// Event triggered when a guild is voted for
manager.on(Events.GuildVote, (vote) => {
    console.log(`User ${vote.userId} voted for guild ${vote.guildId}`);
});

// Event triggered on errors
manager.on(Events.Error, (error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
});
```
